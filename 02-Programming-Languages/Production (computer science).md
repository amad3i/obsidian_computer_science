# Production (computer science)

In computer science, a production or production rule is a rewrite rule that replaces some symbols with other symbols. A finite set of productions 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    
  
 is the main component in the specification of a formal grammar (specifically a generative grammar).
In such grammars, a set of productions is a special case of relation on the set of strings 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
          
        
      
    
    
  
 (where 
  
    
      
        
          

          
          
          
        
      
    
    
  
 is the Kleene star operator) over a finite set of symbols 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    
  
 called a vocabulary that defines which non-empty strings can be substituted with others.
The set of productions is thus a special kind subset 

  
    
      
        P
        ⊂
        
          V
          
          
        
        
          V
          
          
        
      
    
    
  

and productions are then written in the form 
  
    
      
        u
        →
        v
      
    
    
  
 to mean that 
  
    
      
        u
        ,
        v
        ∈
        P
      
    
    
  
 (not to be confused with 
  
    
      
        →
      
    
    
  
 being used as function notation, since there may be multiple rules for the same 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    
  
).
Given two subsets 
  
    
      
        A
        ,
        B
        ⊂
        
          V
          
          
        
      
    
    
  
, productions can be restricted to satisfy 
  
    
      
        P
        ⊂
        A
        B
      
    
    
  
, in which case productions are said "to be of the form 
  
    
      
        A
        →
        B
      
    
    
  
.
Different choices and constructions of 
  
    
      
        A
        ,
        B
      
    
    
  
 lead to different types of grammars.
In general, any production of the form

  
    
      
        u
        →
        ϵ
        ,
      
    
    
  

where 
  
    
      
        ϵ
      
    
    
  
 is the empty string (sometimes also denoted 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    
  
), is called an erasing rule, while productions that would produce strings out of nowhere, namely of the form

  
    
      
        ϵ
        →
        v
        ,
      
    
    
  

are never allowed.
In order to allow the production rules to create meaningful sentences, the vocabulary is partitioned into (disjoint) sets 
  
    
      
        Σ
      
    
    
  
 and 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    
  
 providing two different roles:

  
    
      
        Σ
      
    
    
  
 denotes the terminal symbols known as an alphabet containing the symbols allowed in a sentence;

  
    
      
        N
      
    
    
  
 denotes nonterminal symbols, containing a distinguished start symbol 
  
    
      
        S
        ∈
        N
      
    
    
  
, that are needed together with the production rules to define how to build the sentences.
In the most general case of an unrestricted grammar, a production 
  
    
      
        u
        →
        v
      
    
    
  
, is allowed to map arbitrary strings 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    
  
 and 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    
  
 in 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    
  
 (terminals and nonterminals), as long as 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    
  
 is not empty. So unrestricted grammars have productions of the form

  
    
      
        
          V
          
          
        
        ∖
        ϵ
        →
        
          V
          
          
        
      
    
    
  

or if we want to disallow changing finished sentences

  
    
      
        
          V
          
          
        
        N
        
          V
          
          
        
        (
        
          V
          
          
        
        ∖
        
          Σ
          
          
        
        →
        
          V
          
          
        
      
    
    
  
,
where 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
          
        
        N
        
          V
          
          
        
      
    
    
  
 indicates concatenation and forces a non-terminal symbol to always be present on the left-hand side of the productions, and 
  
    
      
        ∖
      
    
    
  
 denotes set minus or set difference. If we do not allow the start symbol to occur in 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    
  
 (the word on the right side), we have to replace 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
          
        
      
    
    
  
 with 
  
    
      
        V
        ∖
        S
        
          
          
        
      
    
    
  
 on the right-hand side.
The other types of formal grammar in the Chomsky hierarchy impose additional restrictions on what constitutes a production. Notably in a context-free grammar, the left-hand side of a production must be a single nonterminal symbol. So productions are of the form:

  
    
      
        N
        →
        
          V
