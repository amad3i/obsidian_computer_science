# Metaclass (knowledge representation)

In knowledge representation, particularly in the Semantic Web, a metaclass is a class whose instances can themselves be classes. Similar to their role in programming languages, metaclasses in ontology languages can have properties otherwise applicable only to individuals, while retaining the same class's ability to be classified in a concept hierarchy.  This enables knowledge about instances of those metaclasses to be inferred by semantic reasoners using statements made in the metaclass.  Metaclasses thus enhance the expressivity of knowledge representations in a way that can be intuitive for users. 
While classes are suitable to represent a population of individuals, metaclasses can, as one of their feature, be used to represent the conceptual dimension of an ontology.  Metaclasses are supported in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the data-modeling vocabulary RDFS.  
Metaclasses are often modeled by setting them as the object of claims involving rdf:type and rdfs:subClassOf—built-in properties commonly referred to as instance of and subclass of.  Instance of entails that the subject of the claim is an instance, i.e. an individual that is a member of a class.  Subclass of entails that the subject is a class.  In the context of instance of and subclass of, the key difference between metaclasses and ordinary classes is that metaclasses are the object of instance of claims used on a class, while ordinary classes are not objects of such claims. (e.g. in a claim Bob instance of Human, Bob is the subject and an Instance, while the object, Human, is an ordinary class; but a further claim that Human instance of Animal species makes "Animal species" a metaclass because it has a member, "Human", that is also a Class).
OWL 2 DL supports metaclasses by a feature called punning, in which one entity is interpreted as two different types of thing—a class and an individual—depending on its syntactic context.  For example, through punning, an ontology could have a concept hierarchy such as Harry the eagle instance of golden eagle, golden eagle subclass of bird, and golden eagle instance of species.  In this case, the punned entity would be golden eagle, because it is represented as a class (second claim) and an instance (third claim); whereas the metaclass would be species, as it has an instance that is a class.  Punning also enables other properties that would otherwise be applicable only to ordinary instances to be used directly on classes, for example "golden eagle conservation status least concern."
Having arisen from the fields of knowledge representation, description logic and formal ontology, Semantic Web languages have a closer relationship to philosophical ontology than do conventional programming languages such as Java or Python. Accordingly, the nature of metaclasses is informed by philosophical notions such as abstract objects, the abstract and concrete, and type-token distinction.  Metaclasses permit concepts to be construed as tokens of other concepts while retaining their ontological status as types.  This enables types to be enumerated over, while preserving the ability to inherit from types.  For example, metaclasses could allow a machine reasoner to infer from a human-friendly ontology how many elements are in the periodic table, or, given that number of protons is a property of chemical element and isotopes are a subclass of elements, how many protons exist in the isotope hydrogen-2.
Metaclasses are sometime organized by levels, in a similar way to the simple Theory of types where classes that are not metaclasses are assigned the first level, classes of classes in the first level are in the second level, classes of classes in the second level on the next and so on.
